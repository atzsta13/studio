# Prompt History & Key Decisions

This file tracks the important prompts and decisions made during the development of the Sziget Insider app.

1.  **GitHub Integration**: User asked how to add the code to GitHub. I provided the command-line steps but explained I cannot perform the actions directly as I don't have access to external accounts or the user's local machine.

2.  **Initial Feature Scope**: User requested to update the README and define next tasks.

3.  **Data Storage Decision**: User clarified that the app should **only save data locally** on the device. There should be **no user accounts or cloud syncing**. Project files (`README.md`, `docs/backend.json`) were updated to reflect this decision.

4.  **Data Scraping**: User asked to crawl the official Sziget website for the artist lineup. I explained that I cannot access external websites. The lineup data will need to be provided manually.

5.  **Prompt History**: User asked for the conversation history to be saved. I explained that the history is part of the chat interface for context, but I cannot export it. I've created this file as a manual log.
