# Sziget Insider 2026

This is your unofficial, offline-first companion app for the Sziget Festival 2026.

This Next.js project is bootstrapped with Firebase Studio and includes:

*   **Offline-First Experience**: Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), ensuring key features work even with no internet connection on the island.
*   **Full Festival Schedule**: Browse the lineup by day and stage.
*   **Favorites & Conflict-detection**: Mark your favorite artists and get warnings for overlapping set times. All your favorites are saved locally on your device.
*   **Interactive Map**: Find your way around the festival grounds.
*   **Survival Guide**: Essential tips, rules, and emergency contacts.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Next Tasks (Roadmap)

Here are some ideas for the next steps to make this the ultimate fan app:

-   **Food & Drink Finder**: Add a searchable directory of food stalls and bars.
-   **Artist Bio & Music Previews**: Integrate with a music API (like Spotify) to show artist details and play song previews.
-   **AI Recommendations**: Create a GenAI-powered feature to recommend artists based on a user's favorites.
-   **Customizable Map Pins**: Allow users to add their own personal pins to the map (e.g., "My Tent", "Meeting Spot").
-   **Enhanced Search**: Implement a global search to quickly find artists, stages, or guide topics.
