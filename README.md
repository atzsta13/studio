# Sziget Insider 2026

This is your unofficial, offline-first companion app for the Sziget Festival 2026.

This Next.js project is bootstrapped with Firebase Studio and includes:

*   **Offline-First Experience**: Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), ensuring key features work even with no internet connection on the island.
*   **Full Festival Schedule**: Browse the lineup by day and stage.
*   **Favorites & Conflict-detection**: Mark your favorite artists and get warnings for overlapping set times. All your favorites are saved locally on your device.
*   **Interactive Map**: Find your way around the festival grounds.
*   **Survival Guide**: Essential tips, rules, and emergency contacts.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Next Tasks (Roadmap)

Here's the new plan, focusing on the ultimate festival experience:

-   **Smart Packing Checklist**: A customizable list to ensure you bring everything you need.
-   **Food & Drink Finder**: A searchable directory of food stalls and bars.
-   **Set Time Push Notifications**: Get alerts 15 minutes before your favorited artists start.
-   **Friend Finder & Meetups (Future Goal)**: Location sharing on the map to easily find your crew. 
-   **Taste Matcher (On Hold)**: We'll revisit this if the Spotify API becomes available again.
-   **Interactive Map (On Hold)**: We'll wait for the official Sziget map before building this.
