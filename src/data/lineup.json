    "description": "Florence Welch - also known as Florence + The Machine - has announced her sixth studio album Everybody Scream, set for release on October 31. The album’s title track Everybody Scream was written and produced by Florence Welch over the past two years with a close-knit circle of collaborators including Mark Bowen of IDLES, who appears in the video for the single, Aaron Dessner and Mitski. After needing lifesaving surgery on the Dance Fever Tour, Florence’s recovery took her down the path of spiritual mysticism, witchcraft and folk horror as she felt the limits of her body and explored what it means to be “healed”. The album treads through womanhood, partnership, aging and dying; exposing the murky in the mundane. Across five albums - 2009’s Lungs, 2011’s Ceremonials, 2015’s How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, 2018’s High As Hope and 2022’s Dance Fever - Florence has become one of the most monumental artists of a generation, with multiple US and UK #1 albums and countless awards. Known for her earth-shattering live show and singular, iconic voice, Florence has sold out shows and headlined festivals the entire world over. She has collaborated and shared stages with icons - The Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift among them - and published a book of lyrics, poetry and drawings, Useless Magic."

    "description": "Global superstar Lewis Capaldi returns with ‘Almost’ - a soaring, full-band anthem marking his third new single since his comeback. The track arrives ahead of his newly announced EP Survive - out November 14th. Arriving hot on the heels of a critically-lauded return to touring after almost 2 years away, and latest success ‘Something In The Heavens’, his tenth UK Top 10 single, ‘Almost’ is a raw and intimate exploration of what it means to move on - or at least try to. Honest and understated, the song captures the struggle to let go. “I swear to God I’m almost alright, I only think about you all the time,” Lewis admits, showcasing yet again his extraordinary gift for finding truth and emotion in the most nuanced of details."
